<h2>Quantum Computation &ndash; QuantumOperations

<td align="left"><p>QuantumOperations is a library containing implementation of well-known quantum gates and

quantum algorithms for arbitrary amount of qubits. The library is a build-up on the pennylane

package in Python.  All functions from the library are grouped into 3 classes: <b>ClassicalOperations</b>

performing only classical auxiliary computations; <b>QuantumGates</b> with gates which act as building blocks

for quantum circuits; <b>QuantumAlgorithms</b> with high-level quantum circuits. The most interesting algorithms are 

phase-estimation with exponential efficiency, O(n^3) efficient order-finding and

arbitrary unitary operation U (up to 6-qubits) with exponential efficiency.<br />

<td align="left"><p>Following Hastie Tibshirani &ldquo;Elements of Statistical Learning&rdquo;, <b>two techniques</b> are implemented

to make <b>logistic regression model</b> more flexible and robust at the same time: basis expansion using natural splines

and regularization penalizing curvature of the resulting function. Straightforward implementation of these techniques

leads to technical complication: computations are too slow due to numerical integration in the Newton-Raphson routine.

To <b>overcome this issue, a way to perform closed-form integration instead of numerical integration is introduced</b> for both

one-dimensional and multidimensional case.<br />

<h2>Statistical Learning &ndash; Application of Multivariate Kalman Filter: Estimation of Output Gap
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="KF.PNG" alt="600px" width="200px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>Output gap is the difference between actual GPD and potential GDP. Since we do not observe potential GDP,

estimation of the output gap is very useful for assessing the performance of the economy. Conventional methods to

estimate the output gap, such as Hodrick-Prescott filter, have some drawbacks: estimations are unstable to

additions of recent data from last known time-periods and many simple methods don't take into

account other indicators such as interest rate . Kalman Filter helps to avoid these problems. <b>The specification of

multivariate Kalman Filter</b> was built to assess non-linearly the output gap of the Russian economy <b>taking into account

other economic indicators</b>.<br />
